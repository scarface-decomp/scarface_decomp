// The 2 still to do are listed in their place in Original_Binary_Order_PC_1002.cpp as "// [TODO] address name (size)"
// lines, so you can see what is missing and where; matched ones are the C++ itself.

// Blocks marked 'excerpt' are cut from the named source file and are built from that file;
// every other block compiles on its own. The file as a whole is not one translation unit.
