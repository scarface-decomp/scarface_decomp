// SCARFACE: THE WORLD IS YOURS — April 2006 prototype game.xbe, audio/SeqActionWait.cpp (1 verified)
// GENERATED from reports/verified_registry.json by portal/tools/registry_outputs.py. Do not edit.
// PROGRESS: 1 of 6 functions matched (16.67%). NOT COMPLETE YET.
// The 5 still to do are listed in their place in Original_Binary_Order_Proto.cpp as "// [TODO] address name (size)"
// lines, so you can see what is missing and where; matched ones are the C++ itself.
// Every [VERIFIED] block compiled byte-for-byte with Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 13.10.3052 for 80x86.
// Blocks marked 'excerpt' are cut from the named source file and are built from that file;
// every other block compiles on its own. The file as a whole is not one translation unit.

// ============================================================================
// Same machine code as SoundManager::SoundPlayerHandle::vfunc_00 (0x00077F00), which was matched first;
// its addresses and names were swapped for this function's.
// audio::SeqActionWait::vfunc_00 (0x002A3EE0, 36 bytes)
// Starter code written from the disassembly. Names and types are guesses; rename and
// retype them as you work it out. Calls and globals already use their real addresses.
